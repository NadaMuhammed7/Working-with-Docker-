Lovecraft, Austin, and Docker!

When a book has entered “the public domain,” its copyright has expired and the material now belongs to the general public. Not only does this mean that anybody can

creatively reinvent that original work without paying a penny but also that this book is now free for anyone to read. Two of the books which entered the public domain

are HP Lovecraft’s Beyond the Wall of Sleep, and Jane Austin’s Pride and Prejudice.

Given both books (attached as links below), you are tasked to find common words between those two books.

You should consider the following:

Upper-cased and lower-cased words,

Punctuation marks,

Extra white spaces,

The encoding of the files, e.g. utf-8, and

Empty lines

Write a Docker image to perform the previous analysis on both books,
